                Pandey, Divya, et al. “Carbon Footprint: Current Methods of Estimation - 
                Environmental Monitoring and Assessment.” SpringerLink, Springer Netherlands,

            <p>
                This paper by Divya, et al. covers the concept of a carbon footprint, its importance, and how it is 
                calculated in the present day. It factors in the impact of greenhouse gases and the 
                greenhouse effect on climate change. It was useful for me in understanding climate change 
                from the perspective of our world as a whole, rather than separated by community. The paper 
                also contrasts direct and embodied emmissions, giving an insight into the science behind 
                the term "carbon footprint" that we use extensively today when talking about the environment. 
                Through this paper, the author aims to show us the details of what fuels these 
                carbon emissions. From this, I can infer that collectively as a community, we need to 
                reduce greenhouse gas emissions to be able to make a positive change.

                This is a carbon footprint calculator website that allows users to input information 
                such as their annual transportation mode, food intake, shopping habits, and others. 
                Based on this information, it calculates how much their carbon footprint is. 
                This is relevant to my project because it is similar to what I want to do, where 
                users can input their information and visually see what kind of an impact they are 
                making. In the end, the website also suggests things they can do to improve their 
                carbon footprint. My project is also based on helping people improve their habits, 
                so I have a lot to learn from this example. Moreover, I can take some of the factors 
                used to measure environmental impact and use those factors in my own calculations.

                Forest is a mobile app developed by Seekrtech to increase productivity by growing virtual trees. 
                How it works is, whenever a user wants to stay focused, they can plant a virtual tree.
                As they do their work, the tree will keep growing. If they stop working or leave the 
                app halfway through their work, the tree will die. The development team for this app 
                has partnered with Trees for the Future to plant real trees with their proceeds. 
                Users of the app can spend "virtual coins", and for each of these, some money is 
                donated to the Trees for the Future organization to plant a real tree. This app is 
                really inspiring to my project because of the positive reinforcement it provides for 
                users, which is what I am trying to achieve through my project. Also, the real-world 
                impact makes it all the more satisfying for people to use.

            <p>
                Oroeco is a mobile app developed by the company Oroeco based in San Francisco. 
                It is focused on helping people track their environmental impact. Its primary 
                audience is ordinary citizens who want to be involved in making change, and they can 
                do so through their daily habits. This is what my project is about too. It is focused on 
                the ways people can make change every day, so that they don't need to go out of their way 
                to do so. Oroeco also helps people build community by sharing their achievements on social 
                media. My project is related to this because it is also aimed at building community, but 
                it acts more as a public forum where others' achievements are visible, and has no social 
                media integration. I feel Oroeco is a great idea for users to become more involved with their 
                daily habits to improve sustainability, and connects to my project idea very well.
