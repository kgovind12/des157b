        <h1>Usability Test Results</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>
            I tested my project on three different users.
            The specification of this test was to log activities and grow a virtual plant through the interface provided.
            To assess the user experience and potential concerns, I posed the following questions to each of my users:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Do you understand what you need to do to grow your plant? Does the interface communicate this purpose effectively?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What emotions do you feel when you watch the plant grow (satisfaction, joy, frustration, etc.)? Is the overall experience positive or negative?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Is it clear what each button does?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Is the chip selection comprehensive enough? Are there any other options you feel could be included?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Are you able to convey all the information you want through the interface?
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Observations:</h2>
        <p>
            I made four main observations from these tests:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        My users were confused on what makes the plant grow.
                        They weren't sure how the height of the plant was related to the information they provided, or whether the textbox input had anything to do with growing the plant.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't immediately clear that multiple activities could be selected on the form. 
                        All of my users selected one activity each time, then later mentioned that they weren't sure they could select more than one.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Two of my users also tried to press Enter to submit the textbox in the second section. 
                        This called attention to the fact that the interaction with my textbox wasn't accessible enough.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        One of my users was confused as to why the Continue button turned green along with the other activity options.
                        It took her some time to figure out that the button became enabled only after selecting at least one option.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Future Plans:</h2>
        <p>
            Based on these observations, I intend to make the following changes to my project:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Add an info button in the corner of the screen that opens up an information overlay.
                        This overlay will give instructions on how to use the website and include details on what makes the plant grow.
                        I also aim to incorporate a progress bar into the plant page in the final design.
                        This can show users how much progress has been made toward the plant's full height.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Change the chip selection layout slightly on the home page, such that each chip has checkmark icon next to it.
                        These will be unchecked until the user has clicked on the chip, after which it will turn to checked.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To improve accessibility, I aim to make the textbox submit when the user presses Enter.
                        This will then take the user to the plant page directly.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The Continue button on the first page will be slightly more faded, to indicate that it is disabled. 
                        When at least one activity is selected, I aim to make the button less faded, but still the same white background color with a green border.
                        This is so that it does not look too much like a multiselect option/activity, but still shows that it is possible to interact with.
                        On hover, this button can turn green as before.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
